Welcome to the first OCaml Retreat at [Auroville](https://auroville.org/),
India.

This is a week-long hacking retreat, organised by
[Tarides](https://tarides.com/), and inspired by the [Mirage
Retreats](https://retreat.mirage.io/). During the event, we hope to work on a
variety of OCaml projects, including but not limited to the compiler,
concurrency libraries, platform tooling, and benchmarking. It's perfectly fine
if you'd like to work on your own project.

[HackaCamel](https://github.com/tarides/HackaCamel) is a collection of ideas,
small and large, to work on during the retreat and beyond.

## Dates

March 10th 2024 to March 15th 2024

## Target audience

This retreat is designed for those interested in working on OCaml projects.
While OCaml experience is not strictly necessary, familiarity with coding in
OCaml is beneficial. We recommend reviewing the [CS3100 course
assignments](https://github.com/kayceesrk/cs3100_m20/blob/gh-pages/README.md)
beforehand.

## Registration
