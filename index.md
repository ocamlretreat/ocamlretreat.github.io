Welcome to the first OCaml Retreat at Auroville.

This is an OCaml hacking retreat, organised by Tarides, and inspired by the [Mirage Retreats](https://retreat.mirage.io/). During the event, we hope to work on a variety of OCaml projects, including but not limited to the compiler, concurrency libraries, platform tooling, and benchmarking. It's perfectly fine if you'd like to work on your own project.

[HackaCamel](https://github.com/tarides/HackaCamel) is a collection of ideas, small and large, to work on during the retreat and beyond.

**Venue:** [La Vie en Rose, Auroville](https://www.holychichomes.com/auroville)

**Dates:** March 10 to March 15

**Target Audience**

This retreat is designed for those interested in working on OCaml projects. While OCaml experience is not strictly necessary, familiarity with coding in OCaml is beneficial. We recommend reviewing the [CS3100 course assignments](https://github.com/kayceesrk/cs3100_m20/blob/gh-pages/README.md) beforehand.

Registrations are closed for the current retreat. Watch out this space for future retreats.
