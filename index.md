OCaml retreat is an initiative by [Tarides](https://tarides.com/) to bring
[OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) hackers together for a week-long retreat to hack on
projects together. The OCaml retreat is inspired by the [Mirage
Retreat](https://retreat.mirage.io/), which has been successfully bringing
together people working on [MirageOS](https://mirage.io/). 

The [first OCaml retreat]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-03-06-first-ocaml-retreat %}) 
was run between the 10th and the 15th of March 2024 at Auroville. You can read
up about the experience of the attendees [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-03-24-retreat-experience %}).

Our goal is to be able to replicate the OCaml retreat at various places. To this
end, we plan to write down the best practices of running this retreat so that
others may replicate the event elsewhere. Watch this space for future OCaml
retreat announcements.
